# End-to-End Medical Image ML Pipeline

## Overview
This repository demonstrates an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline for 
medical image classification, from data preprocessing to model evaluation for WDBC dataset.

## Pipeline Stages
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Feature extraction
3. Model training
4. Model evaluation and visualization
5. Result interpretation

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Scikit-learn
- OpenCV

## Project Structure
- `data/` – dataset handling
- `preprocessing/` – image preprocessing modules
- `models/` – ML/DL models
- `evaluation/` – performance metrics

## Goal
To demonstrate best practices in building maintainable and scalable ML systems.
