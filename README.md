# Graph Neural Network for Cancer Classification

## Overview
This project explores the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for breast 
cancer classification by modeling relational data between features.

## Key Concepts
- Graph construction from medical data
- Relation-aware GNN models
- Performance comparison with traditional ML/DL models

## Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- NetworkX

## Research Background
Based on published research work in international journals and conferences.
